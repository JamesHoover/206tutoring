			<h1>Using the Test to Defeat the Test</h1>
			<p>Test prep is the most effective investment you can make in your future. At 206 Tutoring, we help you use the SAT and ACT to score scholarships and gain admission to the college of your dreams.</p>
			<p>Our individualized methods ensure that instruction time is used efficiently. Students are fully engaged with the topic during lessons, and can practice productively in between.</p>
			<p>Chris scored 2370 out of 2400 on the SAT, and 339 out of 340 on the GRE. All of our instructors have scored at least 2100 on the SAT, 31 on the ACT, and 330 on the GRE.</p>
			<p>Our secret is using the test to defeat the test—clues to the right answers are everywhere. The key to conquering the SAT reading section is to answer every question literally. ACT math can easily be mastered by treating the answer choices as part of the problem. GRE vocabulary is best understood by relating the words to each other.</p>
			<p>Once our students learn to use the information on a test to their advantage, a little outside study time is often enough to reach their target score.</p>

			<h1>SAT Prep</h1>
			<p>We recommend the SAT over the ACT for strong natural test-takers.</p>
			<p>The SAT consists of three multiple-choice sections (math, reading, and writing), along with a free-response essay. It is slightly easier to prepare for than the ACT. 206 Tutoring is also on the cutting edge of the New SAT, collaborating with other agencies to develop original strategies you won’t find elsewhere.</p>
			<p class="stacked-p"><span class="prominent">Reading, </span>which tests vocabulary and reading comprehension through short passages, is the most challenging section to prepare for—and the one in which we’ve had the most success improving scores. We’ll teach you how to:</p>
			<ul class="inline-list">
				<li>—Save time by skipping and skimming over passages</li>
				<li>—Increase efficiency by using previous questions to answer questions</li>
				<li>—Increase accuracy by discerning the difference between a “literal” answer and a “vague” one</li>
				<li>—Maintain focus and stamina by practicing, so you can finish the section strong and on time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The new SAT will feature graphs and charts alongside the passages, but the overall strategy will remain similar.</p>
			<p class="stacked-p"><span class="prominent">Math, </span>which has multiple-choice and free-response “grid-in” problems, can be conquered with test-prep strategies and reviewing the material, most of which kids learned years ago. We’ll help you improve by:</p>
			<ul class="inline-list">
				<li>—Re-reading questions</li>
				<li>—Correcting simple errors</li>
				<li>—Using the calculator optimally</li>
				<li>—Finding the “easy” way of doing each problem</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The new SAT will cover more material, but the section will still be based heavily on word problems.</p>
			<p class="stacked-p"><span class="prominent">Writing, </span>which asks students to correct sentences and find grammatical errors, is the easiest section to study for. We’ll focus on:</p>
			<ul class="inline-list">
				<li>—Applying common sense to narrow down answer choices</li>
				<li>—Cutting out the irrelevant parts of each passage and sentence to boost speed</li>
				<li>—Teaching the 15 or so grammar rules to answer the more technical questions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The new SAT will present the same type of question within longer passages we can happily skip.</p>
			<p class="stacked-p"><span class="prominent">The essay, </span>is a source of frustration to most test-takers, but not ours! We’ll have you:</p>
			<ul class="inline-list">
				<li>—Brainstorm to generate ideas</li>
				<li>—Outline to organize those ideas</li>
				<li>—Become more comfortable with fitting your writing to prescribed forms</li>
				<li>—Write fluently without repeating yourself to ensure maximum length and creativity</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The new SAT’s essay is outwardly different, but scoring will still value structure over substance over style, making the approach deeply similar.</p>

			<h1>ACT Test Prep</h1>
			<p>We recommend the ACT over the SAT for fast thinkers and math wizards.</p>
			<p>The ACT is more straightforward than the SAT, but its time constraints are difficult and can result in surprise, stress and poor scores the first time around. As a result, our ACT preparation will focus on answering questions efficiently. We offer the following strategies:</p>
			<p class="stacked-p"><span class="prominent">English </span>consists of five passages of fifteen questions each, with an emphasis on grammar and sentence correction. ACT English was used as a model by the new SAT, so the game plan for the two is the same:</p>
			<ul class="inline-list">
				<li>—Skip the irrelevant passages, to save time</li>
				<li>—Learn your grammar rules, to answer tougher questions</li>
				<li>—Manage time wisely to complete as many questions as possible</li>
				<li>—Guess on all the remaining questions</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="stacked-p"><span class="prominent">Math </span>covers more concepts than SAT math, all the way through trigonometry, which means it’s easier—as long as you know math. We will:</p>
			<ul class="inline-list">
				<li>—Help you put that advanced algebra or precalculus class to good use</li>
				<li>—Practice enough to recall concepts and put them into practice, with confidence and speed</li>
				<li>—Use the answer choices to help find an ideal method for approaching each problem</li>
				<li>—Flag, skip, and come back to hard questions, to finish the section on time</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="stacked-p"><span class="prominent">Reading </span>contains four passages (prose fiction, humanities, social science, and natural science) with ten questions each. These questions can be answered very quickly, once you learn to:</p>
			<ul class="inline-list">
				<li>—Recognize the kinds of answers the ACT favors</li>
				<li>—Identify and answer questions based on answers to previous questions</li>
				<li>—Skip around to more specific questions to save time</li>
				<li>—Attack each passage by its topic and genre</li>
				<li>—Sum up the passages in a single sentence, for accuracy and speed</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="stacked-p"><span class="prominent">Science </span>tests the ability to interpret lab reports and graphs. It is similar to the reading section and necessitates no outside knowledge of science. We will:</p>
			<ul class="inline-list">
				<li>—Extend the rules of “literal” and “vague” to apply to graphs, charts, and diagrams</li>
				<li>—Help you distinguish between the different types of passages, to speed up comprehension</li>
				<li>—Focus only on the data you absolutely need to answer each question</li>
			</ul>
